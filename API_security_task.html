<h3>API Security Task</h3>
<p>Our task was to write security requirements which reduce the risks of a data sharing API. I found this very useful to think about, as I assumed a public API didn't really have many security requirements, but actually a public API can be abused. I may find this useful in my future work, as I could be making data available via an API.</p>
<p>I decided to use the Open Notify API for <a href='http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/' target='_blank'>people in space</a>. This returns the details of current humans in space.</p>
<p>I wrote this Python code to use the API.</p>
<pre>import requests
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros")
print(response.json())
</pre>
<p>Here is the response showing 12 astronauts currently in space.</p>
<pre>{

    "number": 12,

        {

<p>The API is public, so there's no need to consider access control, confirming the correct destination, or encryption. However, the API could be abused by an attack such as denial-of-service, or the API could suddenly become massively popular (if a link to it was posted on a very popular site) or possibly a user could write a script which has unintentionally too many or too frequent requests.</p>
<p>A good way to protect the API would be to detect and analyse unusual access, which could be achieved in a number of ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a “cleaning center” service such as <a href='https://www.nexusguard.com/' target='_blank'>Nexusguard</a> to filter out bad traffic.</li>
  <li>Use bad traffic filtering hardware such as <a href='https://levelblue.com/' target='_blank'>LevelBlue</a>.</li>
  <li>Use software such as <a href='https://www.radware.com/' target='_blank'>Radware</a> to detect and block suspicious traffic.</li>
</ul>
