<p>Here's my web scraping Python script - it finds text containing "data scientist" on <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/PG00742/1/MSc-Data-Science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the University of Essex MSc Data Science page</a>.</p>
<pre>import re
import requests
import bs4

page = requests.get("https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/PG00742/1/MSc-Data-Science")

soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")
results = soup.find_all(string=re.compile("data scientist"))

for count, value in enumerate(results):
  if count &gt; 0:
    print(",")
  print("{\"ID\":", count, ", \"text\": \"", value, "\"}", end = "")
</pre>
<p>Here's the output in JSON format.</p>

<p>I'd like to work on finding a more elegant way to do this, but it works!</p>
